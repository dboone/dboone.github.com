A custom silverware drawer organizer made from Poplar. Most of the joints are simply nailed together with the exception of a single half lap joint. I didn't see the need to apply any finish to this piece. Poplar apparently holds up well to repeated contact with water (see antique washboards which are soaked).

I also made a matching kitchen utensil drawer organizer which is just like this one but about twice as deep. These organizers, combined with some fresh non-slip drawer lining, are a great way to keep your kitchen organized.
