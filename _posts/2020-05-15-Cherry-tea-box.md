Unlike other boxes I have made, this design involves gluing all four sides together with the top and bottom panels in place. You cannot access the inside of the box until the glue dries and the lid is _cut_ off. I went light on the glue for this reason (also because the miters were very tight). Once the lid was cut off I created a Poplar liner which is friction fit into place. I was hoping to perform a continuous grain match but I forgot to swap the pieces after resawing. I think this means the grain is continuous on the inside where no one can see it. Either way, the grain does match well on two of the four corners.

I learned a lot while making this box and I look forward to making some more like this.
