Unlike other boxes I have made, this design involves gluing all four sides together with the top and bottom panels in place. This means that you cannot access the inside of the box until the glue dries and the lid is _cut_ off. I went light on the glue for this reason (also because the miters were very tight). When two pieces of wood are matched so closely, where do we expect all that glue to go? I was hoping to perform a continuous grain match but I forgot to swap the pieces after resawing. I think this means the grain is continuous on the inside where no one can see it. Either way, the grain does match well on two of the four corners.

I learned a lot while making this box. I need to make more like this one.
